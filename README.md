#Parrot

## Objectives
1. Practice return values and default arguments
2. Define a method that parrots phrases and has a default phrase

##Instructions

In this lab you'll be defining a method called `parrot`. When you pass `parrot` a phrase as an argument, the method should output that phrase, but also return the phrase. 

The `parrot` method should also have a default phrase. 

**Note** This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return value of a method, not just what it does, but what it returns. Remember, return values are important.
