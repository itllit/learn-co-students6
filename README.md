# Parrot

In this lab you'll be defining a method called parrot. When you pass parrot a phrase as an argument, the method will output that phrase, but also return the phrase. 

**Note** This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return value of a method, not just what it does, but what it returns.

Additionally, the parrot method should have a default phrase.
